        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">A writer is a person who uses written words in different styles and techniques to
            communicate ideas. Writers produce different forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels,
            short stories, books, poetry, plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other reports and
            news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media.
            Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the
            cultural content of a society.

            The term "writer" is also used elsewhere in the arts and music – such as songwriter or a screenwriter – but
            as a standalone "writer" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral
            tradition.

        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Writers have many different reasons for writing, among which is usually
            some combination of self-expression[43] and recording facts, history or research results. The many
            physician writers, for example, have combined their observation and knowledge of the human condition
            with their desire to write and contributed many poems, plays, translations, essays and other texts. Some
            writers write extensively on their motivation and on the likely motivations of other writers. For
            example, George Orwell's essay "Why I Write" (1946) takes this as its subject. As to "what constitutes
            success or failure to a writer", it has been described as "a complicated business, where the material
            rubs up against the spiritual, and psychology plays a big part".</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">The fictional writers</p>
        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Some fictional writers are very well known because of the strength of
            their characterization by the real writer or the significance of their role as writer in the plot of a
            work. Examples of this type of fictional writer include Edward Casaubon, a fictional scholar in George
            Eliot's Middlemarch, and Edwin Reardon, a fictional writer in George Gissing's New Grub Street.
            Casaubon's efforts to complete an authoritative study affect the decisions taken by the protagonists in
            Eliot's novel and inspire significant parts of the plot. In Gissing's work, Reardon's efforts to produce
            high quality writing put him in conflict with another character, who takes a more commercial approach.
            Robinson Crusoe is a fictional writer who was originally credited by the real writer (Daniel Defoe) as
            being the author of the confessional letters in the work of the same name. Bridget Jones is a comparable
            fictional diarist created by writer Helen Fielding. Both works became well-known and popular; their
            protagonists and story were developed further through many adaptations, including film versions. Cyrano
            de Bergerac was a real writer who created a fictional character with his own name. The Sibylline Books,
            a collection of prophecies were supposed to have been purchased from the Cumaean Sibyl by the last king
            of Rome. Since they were consulted during periods of crisis, it could be said that they are a case of
            real works created by a fictional writer..</p>
